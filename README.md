## About The Project

![Screen Shot](http://alsani.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-21-153954.png)

Our Python project aims to automate the classification of X-ray images by leveraging the capabilities of deep learning. This endeavor has the potential to bring significant benefits to both medical professionals and patients. Our objective is to develop a rapid and precise diagnostic tool for the identification of medical disorders from X-ray pictures by utilizing convolutional neural networks and data augmentation techniques. The initiative aims to establish a connection between technology and healthcare, with the objective of optimizing the diagnosis process

## Built With

Import necessary libraries, such as NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, and any other relevant packages for image processing and analysis. Verify that you have access to any datasets or images you'll be working with.

* []()

## Getting Started

Preparing the dataset:
Classify your X-ray images ("normal" and "disease"). Get the dataset and prepare the photos.

Splitting Data:
Divide your dataset into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model.

Optional data augmentation:
Expand the training dataset and improve model generalization with data augmentation.

Choose a Model:
Choose a pre-trained transfer learning model or a custom CNN for classification.

Model Training:
Train the chosen model on the training dataset and evaluate it on the validation set.

Evaluation:
Test the model's accuracy and generalization on another dataset.

Plotting Results:
Visualize training and validation loss and accuracy to analyze model learning. You implemented these stages using TensorFlow (Keras) and PyTorch. After deployment, your model can classify X-ray pictures into important categories to aid medical diagnosis and assessment.

Fine-tuning your model, improving hyperparameters, or integrating it into a medical imaging application may improve your project. Data quality, model architecture, and training will determine the success of your X-ray image classification model. Your model must be monitored and updated to be accurate and reliable in real-world situations.
